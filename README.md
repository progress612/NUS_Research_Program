# NUS Research Program: Dynamic Treatment Regime in Parkinson's Disease

Save some files that needed to share. Core codes are all in PD_DTRs.Rmd. After some days I will also upload my thesis about this project.

## Data Sources

The data to reproduce the analyses has to be obtained from https://www.ppmi-info.org/ and placed in the raw-data directory. I suggest you download the whole repository in https://github.com/jkrijthe/pdmed and place PD_DTRs.Rmd inside.

## Acknowledge

I refered Jesse H. Krijthe's work in PPMI in most data preprocess part, his code can be found here: https://github.com/jkrijthe/pdmed. Some of the model diagnostics code were asked from Prof.Wallace, his personal website: https://mpwallace.github.io/ (you can ask code from him).

Thanks for the guidance from Duke-NUS professor Bibhas Chakraborty and my supervised Ph.D. Yan Xiaoxi, it was a very nice experience in Singapore.

Thanks for the patient teaching and detailed mails by Waterloo professor Michael Wallace and McGill professor Erica EM Moodie, your selfless codeshare also helps me a lot.

THANKS to everyone I have learned from in past 4 years!
